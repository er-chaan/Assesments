Nodejs Task


You need make a chat platform in nodejs.

so the flow will be like this.
??- show dummy page with chatbox.
??- show user id in chatbox
??- userid must be unique for each user (a random number assigned by server) and will same for him life time...
user can enter his nick name show people can see his name only when chating with him.
??- if i do change my name it should be updated to all users who are chatting with me right now.
??- user id is only way to connect with other people. 
??- even if i open same url two tabs both tabs will have same user id means it will consider me as same user.
??- if reload the page chat should resume at where it was.
??- user will enter another user's id in chatbox to start chat with him
??- user can add more member in already running chat by entering another user's id.

Client Side:
for client js framework you can use your choice of system or flow. or library.  

Important points
- everything should be in sync all the time in all tabs for that same user...
- if start chat form one tab it should be started in another tab as well. if i do close one all should be closed.
- we can do group chat.. if enter somebody's user_id and if he is already chatting then i'll be 
      joined into them we'll be a group now or even he can add me while chating with somebody.
- we must see whom we are chating with.

Database:
no need to save anything about users in database. 
its all done in realtime so you can save messages within nodejs.

following must be used:
