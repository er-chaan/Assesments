The task is to write a program in Node that takes a list of URIs, 
performs HTTP requests to fetch them and collects the responses. 
Deliverable is the source code with config files, data files if any, 
couple of paragraphs on solution, build instructions. 

Option 1: If you decide to write a command line based tool
1.       take the input list of URLs from a text file
2.       every 2 seconds print out the current status of the requests
3.       When all requests are done, print the final results and exit

Eg.
Input text file:
https://www.google.com
https://www.indusface.com/products
http://does.not.exist/test

every 2 seconds
https://www.google.com : Succcess. Status Code = 200
https://www.indusface.com/products : pending
http://does.not.exist/test : Failed (error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ...(basically the error received from library call))
 
final (similar to above)

 
Option 2: write a simple REST service
1.       take the input list of URLs in an API, POST /multiGet, JSON body will hve array of URLs
2.       Have another API to print out the current status of the requests, GET /status

Eg.
POST /multiGet
Body is:
{
    "urls" : [
        "https://www.google.com",
        "https://www.indusface.com/products ",
        "http://does.not.exist/test"
    ]
}
 
GET /status
Response (JSON) is:
{
    "urls": [{
            "url": "https://www.google.com",
            "status": "Success",
            "statusCode" : "200"
        },
        {
            "url": "https://www.indusface.com/products",
            "status": "pending"
        },
        {
            "url": "http://does.not.exist/test",
            "status": "Failed",
            "error" : "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND"
        }
    ]
}
